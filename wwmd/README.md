### Unsolved Problems/ Major Hurdles
My major hurdle has been uploading my project to Heroku, because 
 of PaperClip which ask for an aws account so that the images can
 be stored in a database once it has been deployed onto Heroku.
 Creating nested comments was also a problem for me because I was having 
 trouble targetting the right post that the comment belong to.
